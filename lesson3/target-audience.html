            <p>
                1. Andrea decided to look for ways to expand her business. She has been doing it online but wants to open her physical store and doesn't know where to start.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Andrea feels the need to find people that know more about this type of business and would like to talk and meet with some people soon. She decided to look online to see what she can find about it and found the chamber of Commerce.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Kevin loves spending time at the restaurant, but feels that he is not spending enough time with his family, he feels that after 10 years the restaurant is stable, and can now hire someone to take care of it a few days of the week, he doesn't know where to start since it is a great responsibility to manage a restaurant, he decides to search for it online and found the chamber of commerce website.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Kevin has seen some increases in every week spending at the restaurant, he wants to know if his restaurant can be re-structured to reduce costs in things that might not even be necessary or probably are taking more than they should. He decides to search for it online and found the chamber of commerce website.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Andrea has finally found a cofounder for her clothing company, they both feel like they need to connect with other companies before they start their physical store, joining with companies that have similar goals and related producsts might help them achieve their goal.
